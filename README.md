# TrainDekho-Extension
Train Emergency Alert Extension is designed to provide passengers a fast and careful way to alert authorities during emergencies.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Secret Emergency Trigger**
- Users can activate a hidden emergency alert through the extension by pressing a clearly labeled button within the app.
- Includes a **5-second warning modal** before sending the alert to prevent false alarms.
- If the user is unable to cancel within the countdown, the alert is automatically sent.

### **2. Real-Time Alerts**
- Sends an immediate notification with the user’s **real-time location** and **train details** to the nearest station and police.
- The alert includes a pre-configured message to ensure quick action:
  *"Emergency! Possible hijacking on Train [Train Number]. Immediate assistance required at [Location]."*

### **3. Hijacker Mitigation**
- If the user cannot interact due to pressure from hijackers, the extension ensures:
  - Automatic alert dispatch if the warning isn’t declined within 5 seconds.
  - Silent feedback (like vibration or screen flash) to confirm the alert is sent.

### **4. Offline SMS Fallback**
- If internet connectivity is unavailable, the alert is sent via **SMS** to pre-configured emergency contacts (e.g., 112 or 100).

### **5. User Authentication**
- Ensures only verified users can send alerts by integrating with phone number or Aadhaar verification systems.
